# Enemy Sound Effects

## What to put here:

### NEW Sounds Needed:
- `enemy_hit.ogg` - Player hits enemy (spin attack)
- `enemy_death.ogg` - Enemy defeated
- `enemy_alert.ogg` - Enemy notices player (optional)
- `enemy_attack.ogg` - Enemy attacks (optional)

## Sound Design:
- Hit: Impact sound, punch/kick
- Death: Defeat sound (can be comedic/cartoonish)
- Alert: Surprise sound effect

## File Format:
- `.ogg` format
- Keep sounds distinct from player sounds

## Variation:
Can have different sounds for different enemy types!
