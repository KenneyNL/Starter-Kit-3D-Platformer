# Collectible Sound Effects

## What to put here:

### NEW Sounds Needed:
- `fruit_collect.ogg` - Picking up fruit (can be similar to coin sound)
- `life_gain.ogg` - Gaining extra life (special, celebratory sound!)
- `gem_collect.ogg` - Special collectible (optional)
- `fruit_bundle.ogg` - Collecting multiple fruits at once (optional)

## Already Exists:
- `coin.ogg` ✓ (can be reused for fruits if needed)

## Sound Design Tips:
- Fruit collect: Bright, positive, short (~0.2-0.5 sec)
- Life gain: Longer, celebratory (~1-2 sec) with ascending tones
- Make it satisfying! This is key to "one more try" psychology

## File Format:
- `.ogg` format
- Keep file sizes small
