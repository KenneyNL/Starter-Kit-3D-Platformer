# Enemy Character Models

**Source:** Kenney Animated Characters or Character Pack

## What to put here:

Pick 2-3 simple enemy models from the Character Pack:

### Recommended:
- `enemy_patroller.glb` - Basic enemy that walks back and forth
- `enemy_spinner.glb` - Spinning/rotating enemy
- `enemy_jumper.glb` - Hopping enemy (optional)

### Good Enemy Types:
- Small blob/slime creatures
- Simple robots
- Generic monsters
- Animal characters

## Naming Convention:
Rename downloaded models to:
- `enemy_TYPE.glb` (e.g., `enemy_blob.glb`, `enemy_robot.glb`)

This keeps naming consistent and clear!

## Animation:
If the models have animations, Godot will auto-import them.
We'll set up simple patrol AI for these enemies.
