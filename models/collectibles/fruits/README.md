# Fruit Models (Collectibles)

**Source:** Kenney Food Kit (https://kenney.nl/assets/food-kit)

## What to put here:
- `apple.glb` - Main collectible fruit
- `orange.glb` - Alternative fruit
- `banana.glb` - Alternative fruit
- `cherry.glb` - Small bonus fruit (worth more points)
- `watermelon.glb` - Rare fruit (worth 5+ fruits)

## Usage:
These will be the main collectibles in the game (like Wumpa fruit in Crash Bandicoot).
Collect 100 fruits = 1 extra life!

## File Format:
- `.glb` or `.gltf` 3D models
- Kenney assets are usually scaled correctly (1 unit = 1 meter)
